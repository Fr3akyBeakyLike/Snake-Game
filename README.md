# Snake-Game
Snake Game created with HTML and Javascript.

I wanted to learn a little bit more about Javascript and doing that by creating a snake game.
Code Explained a channel on youtube made a guide about where he explains everything in the code and even added his images en sounds.
Everything used with code is based on his guide, so if you like it please check him out!
